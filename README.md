# Motif_finding
When working with synthetic S.cerevisiae, specifically after inducing large-scale genome rearrangements with SCRaMbLE, scientist want to know in which location the rearrangements happens and then associate the phenotype with the resulted genotype. These series of scripts aims to search for Loxpsym motifs in synthetic chromosomes to afterwards associate the biological info._
